It’s super durable so I don’t have to worry about it breaking or denting, which is great. It comes in a myriad of sizes so there’s really a perfect container for everyone. If you’re deciding between 2 sizes, get the bigger one. I was contemplating the same thing and I went with the smaller one and now realize I should’ve went up to the next size. It’s just great storage and you’ll use the space, trust me, so get the bigger one. Overall a great product. Buy it, you won’t regret it.",

	var commentsList = [{"user":"Brianne","content":"I was so pleasantly surprised when I received the Herb Guard container because it was so sleek, small yet still hefty. I also love that the glass is black, so no one can see what you're storing. At 100ml, you can store spices or cannabis without worry that they'll grow stale over time. The UV protection is a serious benefit, because other jars I've used in the past let light in and my herbs would lose potency which is always a buzzkill (pun absolutely intended). This jar comes with a few other perks too: a plastic, black travel bag with a ziplock seal, a soft cloth for cleaning any impurities or dust collected over time (reminds me of a device cleaning cloth you'd use for your laptops or iPhones), a scoop for use with either the jar or the travel bag, and three white Herb Guard labels should you decide to repurpose this jar for different storage uses. Its design fits well with other storage options or appliances, whether black or stainless steel. If you opt for storing spices, this jar will complement your kitchen!I'm not in the habit of testing products by dropping or throwing them to see if they break, this jar has already been knocked off of my coffee table and I didn't have to worry about a thing. The glass seems very strong. I did, however, test this jar under water and it truly is 100% airtight. Although the lid isn't made of glass like the rest of the jar, it's very sturdy and high quality. My only wish, like other reviews I've seen, is that there was some sort of extra ring/padding to further protect any space between the jar and the lid. Even so, I've held this jar right up to my nose and I can't smell anything. It locks in the smell, no matter what you store. Trust me, buy with confidence so you can smoke with confidence.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 1   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-11-28 17:49:45"},{"user":"Andrew Hahn","content":"The Herb Guard just arrived today, here are some initial thoughts:It's a good sturdy jar. I'm kind of a jar nerd as it is, so this was fun to get. I tried it out with some powdered cloves since I know they have a pretty powerful scent. The jar lives up to the claim that it's scent-proof. I'm no bloodhound, but I couldn't smell a whiff. I subsequently submerged the jar in water for a few minutes to test it's air-tight claim and it passed with flying colors. The powdered cloves were safe and dry. Whew!While I can't attest to it's ability to keep things fresh for long-term or how well the UV guard works, it's decidedly opaque. Combine that with it being air-tight and it seems like it could live up to that claim.The overall design and packaging are top-notch. It'll look good no matter where you store it. It comes with a handy scoop and travel baggy that opens up nicely.In the box:100ml glass jar, plastic capTravel resealable pouch (think heavy-duty Ziploc)ScoopCleaning clothJar labelsWhat I'd improve on:? There was some static build up with the powdered cloves, so if you're storing something that's affected by static, this could be an issue.? It would be nice if there was an o-ring at the base of the lid to really snug it up. As it still maintains a tight seal without it, this isn't a deal-breaker.? The lid (plastic) and the jar (glass) resist smudging pretty well so the included cloth seem a little superfluous. But hey, free glasses cloth!? I'm worried I'll lose the scoop since it doesn't fit inside the jar. As that would reduce my ability to store my herbs, this isn't a deal-breaker either. But a clip or a magnet or something to keep it attached would be great.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 1   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-10-06 17:49:45"},{"user":"N.G.","content":"I bought this jar to store coffee in. Normally, I grind my coffee every day, but often I find I have a few spoonfuls left over. Usually, I just toss it in a tuperware container for the next day but I swear it goes stale over night. So I got to looking for a small air tight jar. Most of the coffee jars were too big, and kinda ugly. Came across this UV protected jar and loved the look, and the price was right.I've used this for a few days now, storing left over coffee over night. No more stale coffee! I know that a lot of people are concerned with smells when buying these herb jars, but not a wiff of coffee smell gets through, so this thing seals up tight.Anyways, love the jar. It's really sturdy, well built, and has a clean professional look. Also, the package comes with a lot of stuff. Been using the fingerprint wipe for my computer, lol, so far it works great.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 1   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-10-30 17:49:45"},{"user":"Kyle","content":"This jar has plenty of room to store whatever you put in it and locks the smell in very well. It has a good weight to it and fits the hand perfectly as well as being small enough to put anywhere out of site. I threw some gun powder tea in there and forgot about it for a few days. Couldn't smell a thing until I opened it and the aroma filled the air. It's been a few months now since I've emptied my container and you can still smell the tea that was in there before. Mine did not come with the lables or the humidity pack, but it's still a high quality the product and does the job. The resealable pack comes in handy too and is just as smell proof as the jar.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 1   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2018-03-04 17:49:45"},{"user":"rky222k","content":"Thick, nice lid, great seal, includes accessories.Alot more expensive than the other amazon options, but these are actually very nice, and actually re-fresh dried out herb surprisingly well. I didn't think it could actually help that much, but I put in some dried out herb and it got its color back and became fluffy again after 2-3 days of being sealed in these.FYI: The listing shows HG logo on the jars, I got the 100ml 3-pack and they do not have any logos printed on them at all. Which I actually prefer. Not sure if some sizes have it and some don't, of if they have since stopped putting it on there.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 3   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-23 17:49:45"},{"user":"BMurray","content":"I live in a small apartment where smoking indoors isn't allowed and can easily be overpowered by strong odors.

It\u2019s super durable so I don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking or denting, which is great. It comes in a myriad of sizes so there\u2019s really a perfect container for everyone. If you\u2019re deciding between 2 sizes, get the bigger one. I was contemplating the same thing and I went with the smaller one and now realize I should\u2019ve went up to the next size. It\u2019s just great storage and you\u2019ll use the space, trust me, so get the bigger one. Overall a great product.
